## Misc

### Get automatic updated

Enable workflow [Sync upstream](.github/workflows/repo-sync.yml) to automatically sync upstream updates. (force push)

#### Syncing workflows updates

Upstream workflows is not allowed to be synced without providing a GitHub Access Token with `workflows` permission. You
need to manually sync upstream updates if any workflows changed.

Alternatively, you could set GitHub Action secret `SYNC_GITHUB_TOKEN` to enable auto update workflows.
